Chunk 0 - Text: good morning and good afternoon to everyone so along with me Vikas Bhardwaj and Sanjeev will be the instructor for today session so because over to you so the point is because the management has asked us to give no how of Nokia system to all of the I mean your name has been given to us by the managers so it looks that we it was it support thinking that we are just starting to the Nokia system to you guys I mean you don't have any working experience on Nokia system if you have it is good so I mean we have your details like how much how many years experience you have what is your primary competence what is the secondary competence so will be starting page where we have make the summary of the training of my screen is visible to all parts of the training first will be the Nokia overview like how you take the KPI from the Nokia performance manager we call it pm + these days from CM editor then alarm and taking parameter we call it a dump parameter dump so you can set parameter database or like how to change the parameter from operation manager so that the first part second part will be going through like how Nokia audits work with like how you do plan and other working on the tool moves up and then mind to see like how you how you see how the parameter description which feature it related to parameter to
Chunk 1 - Text: parameter as well and same goes with the first one web element Manager which gives you the physical view of the inert BG not be and the node b is like how you can you can login into it if you have the privileges from the customer and change the parameter from the wavelength manager as well and after that in later part will be giving you the overview of Nokia kpis and the last point is the hardware introduction to like what is the system module radio module type of Nokia architecture is will be starting from the network and he is having the login if you can share and let's start from the PM plus itself I just want to know who all is having or doesn't have Nokia exposure as of now I mean just to have you know you can read your handset ok so I didn't like everyone is my screen you might be having different kind of connections through which you can go either through a glass of what we have it or what we are using it was one of course navigate to
Chunk 2 - Text: Citrix so this is how it goes whatever tools do we have it all are listed over the Citrix so I mean the moment you will click it on necklaces click on this network navigate me to the different page which would be so will have this kind of scenario where you can see administration configuration monitoring reporting security uses so all different all these types have different you know importance or you can say relevance with respect to its own area Click one by one will go through it so let's say if we look into administration so we got four different types which is like dynamic adaptation and integration Wizard plantation mediator and the fourth one is working set manager so I mean after this for the most frequently used as a working set manager the manager to this page now this working set manager I mean it can be created at any level it could be either at cell level BTS level Mr BTS level depending upon you know so it has its own you can say DN to which it can be created so let's say if you want to see specific D and how it is created or distance of one of the working set is which is already created so you will see the DNA is like this and this Mr BTS ID so
Chunk 3 - Text: can we created at the cell level and the BTS level as well so it all depends upon how you how you want to face the KPI based on that you can let's say I will select maybe for ok create a new one just entered in over here so these are the five BTS of 5 or 6 BTS which I am trying to create working set the moment I import it here if at all if you find any error or if any of the BTS is having you know some ambiguity in terms of operations or it is the duplicate object which is which is somehow not deleted from the oasis and it is still there you might find some you know about BTS so you need that would be attacked which will pop up over which states that you can exclude those BTS or you can simply by clicking this one test 24 so my object is created actually if I want to give it to go back here so only my working set so the moment you want to switch it on I can see whatever working set which I have created so this is the working set which I created just now and it's so this is how working
Chunk 4 - Text: over one attack and we do have npm as well I mean there is a separate process of getting things imported and our website created so will go through that process may be some letter at some later stage I'm just giving a text over you as of now anyone can time in between if you have any doubt or query or you can just raise the query over the chat as well and Vikas would be taking care of that ok so this is where I mean how we use the working set manager moving on to again this is the configuration part the moment you will click 10 or 12 different types of the most frequent one used is same operation manager CM editor and site all of them has its own importance it depends upon the domain which guys guys are working on likely if someone is specifically involved in software application part so it is the software manager what they will be using it someone is specifically who is just implementer of the plan there will be using HTML operation manager if you want to view any parameter is it is very comes into picture and then we got side configuration tool so I will be going one by one so let's say operation manager Sa
Chunk 5 - Text: time so this is how the view would be it's like you will get a file from this we got two different options either to import auto export so let's say if you want to export a particular dumb now dump it could be related to any of the above which you want to fetch it on so like let's say if you want to fetch any Dam just go on to this actual export actual configuration but if you want to fetch it for the entire PLM and you just need to click over here or if you want to go for a specific BTS just expenditure just click on the desired BTS which you want to let's say which you want to say if I want to search for these two BTS I just selected this 320 no different types which comes under like different comes into picture it could be if you want to fetch anything which is related to hardware it's gonna be ml object where you can find some hard related things then it's for the parameter it will get pop up in BTS if you want to fetch anything which is related to another thing of it will come under NR BTS for the object of parameter which comes under as Run so we have a better for this one so it could be and BTS and Hardware and BTS so if you want to fetch any specific amount two different options if you just want to answer all of this subject only you can just take it over here and check
Chunk 6 - Text: that's one thing if you but you will see that all different objects are still take so this can be unchecked from here as well so I have unchecked it from every single object from here and I'll go to the LT BTS like let's say LT BTS and I will select object like
Chunk 7 - Text: so this is the term which I just said it's like it's just underscore 123 lower my local drive can we define this path to an FTP location or any other parts should be mapped with lyrics 1 2 3 result this is the if you just so this is my assistant KV will pass it to a tool and I will get explain you how to pass it and what to do we use it but before going to that part let's understand how it works so this is how specific time if you want to run a specific plan you need to import a plan which is why this type ok and again you need to take care of one
Chunk 8 - Text: you I mean that whatever plan what you have prepared whether it is in IV or UI I mean we should not message while importing and so like let's say I already have one plan it was saved over just change it for the moment you will give bath and you will import it is going to give you this option of getting it important so let's start it will give you error or warning if any if there is no error running we can proceed with the plan activation of reactivity procedure since we are not allowed to execute any execute any plan by our services to implement it so we normally we validate things and we just give it to RCM time to just executed so this is how this import party works let it gets imported and then we can move on from this party that was the path from the same operation manager one more thing I mean there are a number of things that can be seen let's say we have a specific plan which is already implemented
Chunk 9 - Text: Lalit ka new of the one you can always click on this plan I click over here you can export the plan let's say you're working on a specific reason and you found one specific plan which has which cause the degradation you want to see what all changes were and what all I was associated you can always export the plan so let's say I want to I don't know what this PDF changes for export plan the moment you export this plan just need to check on the BTS if it is already if you want to get exported for the entire BTS or let's have the option of getting it important over ivo like this is how I mean you can export a plan from same operation which is already executed ok just to know the time it gets imported I mean we can see how it works I already have this plan and in my local folder let's say this one you can come here write the plan name you will see here is already here
Chunk 10 - Text: to provision it here plan of type of provisioning things so we got different different options that can be you know seen so one is the activate which we are not allowed to I mean some guys might have you know that implement plan but we don't have it over this project so we can react with this plan you always have option to UN selected if you want to like let's say one specific BTS giving you error just answer this one check all over and you can and check specific BTS from here and then you can start the free activation so it will tell you how many errors to do you have it or any dependencies are there or any pdl validation errors are there or like let's say any BTS which is which has the connection Timeout so all those can be listed you can always check it during free activation you can clean your plan accordingly and for that you can you give fine plan for implementation final implementation so I am just be activating it for now with this and it will start it will take some time maybe for collecting for getting all info it will try creating a backup as well as early and started and then it will start checking against the BTS the objects where you want to change the parameters

Chunk 11 - Text: are we clear any query from any one of the audience may be one of the colleagues just a minute so in this way we can reactivate our plan we can check how things goes as per I mean the BTS and all you started running you can filter your messages from here on the type itself you always have three options like information warning or ok don't have any error in the plan that's why I mean there is no such error kind of thing which appeared as of now but let's say one find BTS having any issue or error due to current time or any other relevant related error basically it will get populated you can like let's say I want to check how much 645 or 656 it is true activation part
Chunk 12 - Text: let's plan so you remember we were importing one specific plan with this so we got one error let's click on their currency what it states that this specific Mr BTS with this invalid demo class so we might go back to this specific and check what is wrong with this DN with DNA exist or anything else with this site just we can see warning as well how many water so these are some generic error of which we get during you know it's not it's a basically warning that object has been created with different parts of warning this can be ignore this one let's go back to the plan which we were running and see states that reactivation has been filled so let's go vacancy if we have any error so we got some few of the BTS which has no matter this could be due to any of the parameter depend
Chunk 13 - Text: and or any object missing the plan and then you will see this one may be this specification time out it might have some temporary outage due to which I mean while creating it is unable to reach that BTS same goes for other to BTS as well so this is how you react to CM operations again we have option of IMO upload like let's say you have you have implemented a plan and you don't see changes which got the plan is implemented so we always have the option of you know refresh our object you can refresh our object either at 11 level it always depends so you can select you want to go for a specific object and parameter and you can start what will do it will try to refresh each and everything over the BTS at object level of parameter level whatever you want to selected different type we have a city which is exact configuration tool so
Chunk 14 - Text: Sandesh we can export HCF we have all we always have a specific you know time time on Window under which this and this normally our operation teams use it for as a part of backup like let's say one find the site went down and there are unable to restore it so what they should they collect the steps from the site so we can select BTS from here you can select if you want any specific HCF you can always come here just check this one out and download it this is the type which you can download the app so this is how this site configuration tool works so our next step
Chunk 15 - Text: let's wait for the step to get open you can always move back and see some other countries if you want to see this is our monitoring tab let's take some time to open its not take some time
Chunk 16 - Text: so we have the same it open now I mean it can be used in multiple way like let's say someone has run a plan for BTS and you are not able to find what we can see a history of the last 30 days over here that can be seen that let's say you can opt a specific radius for instance and one fine thing that can be seen is to you can check the parameter what are the parameter settings
Chunk 17 - Text: let's say if I want to see whether load base India its enable or not you can see it is said to true if you know specific parameter which you want to check or you want to Filter it out you can always type parameter name it will give you two option is the abbreviation or you can select it and you can always search with the full name as well that's one thing if you want to see like let's say if is there any changes that has been performed last and minus 7 days and -10 is just right click on this BTS you can launch the same history with the timeline let's say I want to see what has happened since 5th of March over this BTS I can generate a report in late so I mean if there are certain changes that has been pushed from the outside the BTS those will get popped up on the network oriented changes and if there is something which is plant driven it will come it as
Chunk 18 - Text: plan name for resistance and over this aluminium I don't get anything I don't see any changes which is at like let's say for this specific valence shell that has been changed in part which is done by a man which which was my plan itself this was the name of my plan and it has been activated by this user so one fine day if you find any not degradation or anything which you unable to quality always can go back to the BTS you can check CM history who has done what who has implemented you can check it over there and you can see the plan name plan name from here you can extract the plan and use of CM editor as well the same time compare and restore and we can view conflict part as well so this is how I mean you can use the same address we can use CM editor for this plan creation as well for list parameters so this is the how we use my letters ok any query with respect to CM editor
Chunk 19 - Text: since I don't have anything I am assuming no one has any query moving on to next part just within through CM editor CM operation manager site configuration software manager it is being used by our software application team I mean if they want to move on 23 R1 and if you want to move on to 24 hour one based on the licences provided any kind of operation that can be done with this software manager then we got licence Manager from this we can see what all licence licence to we have it with respect to features and specific features ok now we want to this part monitor which just open
Chunk 20 - Text: so this is our monitor I mean we can do some alarm monitoring via this let's say we have all the listed BTS over here click it over here it will get expanded if you know the BTS number of BTS name you always have a option of clicking it over this one and then will you can search it like let's say 303010 11 this is like Melbourne Cricket Ground cricket ground if I want to see specific BTS I mean what all alarms for you just need to click right click on this BTS will have option of finding we can see alarm list plus alarm history so like what I am just like what does this video is having current alarm if it is it has any so we do have some critical you know alarm basically if you want if you are investigating something out and you suspect some hardware issue you can always login to this monitor see what all alarms are there if it really give it to the operation system for the rectification that's one thing we can also see alarm history depends upon the aggregation does team team has based on that aggregation
Chunk 21 - Text: accumulate the alarm if you want to see the specific BTS whether it is reachable or not just you can right click it over here and an element manager you can there is a term called Pink you can think you BTS and see whether pinging is getting successful or not so probably looks like this PTS is not reachable how many tried and 100% packet loss so you can stick this part as well to your patient team that are BTS is not reachable they will act accordingly so that's one thing and if you want to login to the BTS as well as option of login into read write a read only I'll go for this one let's say so it is navigating me to the element manager could be two things that can be done you can see individual set alarm from this let's see if any specific specific monitoring is not drive has been planned so we can always create object or a group and we can keep it as it is like I have this group created and it will it gives me the list of alarm for that specific group
Chunk 22 - Text: those will come under works at level so you can click on the group and right click on the group and it will give you the alarm for that specific group all the BTS associated with that group that's one thing so this is how our monitor comes into picture or you can say we cannot alarm existing alarm plus current alarm and based on this we can always reach our operations team for rectification so like we all have seen that I have navigate to monitor to this specific BTS so I mean this is element manager and this is how are BTS looks like we can always have a view at site level you what all radius that has been deployed and how many sectors are there if you want to see sales how many cells are deployed we can click on the cells it will give you the view overall number of cells that has been deployed over this since its small cell or it's a scenario where cricket ground so we have multiple cells and has a hardware issue so that's why we can see these are already we can see how connections are going I mean how our area and are connected with our
Chunk 23 - Text: radio module and then it is further connected to the red and then how these rates are further connected to this our inner cell group so this is if you want to see how connection course this is the detailed side view and how many mm is MMS in pool do we have it for the configured for a specific site so this can be seen from this one moreover if you want to see specific parameters like if you already logged into the specific BTS if you are not comfortable with the term you can always go to this configuration part and in this parameter editor so if you want to view any specific object parameter or overall you can always search specific parameter and these are the plant value we can also added specific parameters like activate CSF current value is set to false we can set it to true you can validate plan and validation is done we can activate this activation plan will come into picture you can activate plan and activate it at BTS level but again there are some restrictions at a level that we are not the one who should change
Chunk 24 - Text: parameter by Aircel it should come through a specific process to a specific team so though we have rights but we don't exercise it so that's one thing so I mean this is this is how this web element Matchbox you need to China ok let me go back what just a minute we have already covered this walking set via an attack we have covered then we have a manager which we have seen a monitor and then operations manager so through all this part is being done like at least first step which is being done now will go on to this let's say if we have specific done how to mean there can be two things through which you can direct
Chunk 25 - Text: I had some voice I mean someone wants to anyone has any query now OK Google how to fetch that exactly exactly so I was I mean we can always search KPI from the attack as well and then we have a pm plus so I'm going to this npm class so the moment will click on this one npm + different different things that can be done so if you want to view any specific API and specific counters those are all those are listed here so I will go one by one sort of this one baby three line right so we have content Explorer KPI manager scheduler
Chunk 26 - Text: shoulder and profile so let's go to this content Explorer so sorry sorry different things here like boats how many votes are there then reports and then the work working sets ok so this account is used to take some time so if you want to see in any specific board you can always come here like let's go to BMW if you want to search anything click it over just right so I can I will get whatever the report what we have it with the name CA or it has it has you know it has this letter C associated so that's one thing I mean if you want to search what you can always search it here if you want to create a specific worksheet again there are two great working set the one which you have created in attack some time to get in sync with pm plus may be 6 hours independence
Chunk 27 - Text: you can see specific object on this basically these are the csv which is already created we need to just click it over one and we can directly import it like let's say I will just name it again test underscore 1234 ok it has some error it is already may be some of the BTS as some issue so we just need to filter what all BTS have some issue and we need to define those BTS pull out those pictures from the group and import the things what needs to be taken into consideration or what needs to be taken care is like it has a specific maybe you can say nomenclature so it will be like this name if you are making it work so name should be the first thing which comes into picture followed by the colon and then double quotes on then DNA and this should be the format under which it should get imported this name it could be either a cell name BTS name and everything should be at 7 level if it is Mr BTS or NR BTS so that should be accordingly as per Anar BTS or Mr BTS so this is how we import our working set an alarm set we can always go back to reporting now we have different tabs
Chunk 28 - Text: Roadways we do have KPS Encounters if you want to fetch specific API or counter just click it over here KPI if I want to let's say fetch specific counter from the sorry KPI from the 5G side I will expand it over any specific object you will get $3 to add to a new word go to customer release initial due to user inactivity these are the some options it could be either at minute level our days weeks or months so let's say I want to set it for 7 days maybe from last midnight you can set it level analysis and then we have aggregation it could be either at the level our level month level raw level so the number of rows or you can say about pm counter has been defined it could be normal it should be 15 minutes but again there are some pm counters which takes more space due to which the community has been set to 1 hour so you might find some of the KPI is which you try to pull at all level but it is not getting the moment you will change it at our getting just because how our pm counters has been defined in the OSS to reduce the
Chunk 29 - Text: casual for the process so let's say level for and again at day level we have option to either show it at a chart level data table and all let's go child labour for once and see what looks like so these are the these are the API value for the specific control the last seven days we have option of converting it into we can switch on to data table as well so these are the I mean table level it is coming like this we can always import different set like let's say I want to introduce ok just click on this one at two board and this one what we have seen is it has appended additional KPL on to the same board so we can always happen on the same code or different port depending upon the need how you want to present the data so that's one thing after this I mean this is how you can face let's see if you want to see you want to analyse specific counter you can always come down there are different differently so you have to be sure I mean on which specific release you are working on to and what
Chunk 30 - Text: like let's say I'll search 5750 specifications and those are all open so the moment you will click 5750 it will pop up with respect to all the release so it all depends upon you which specific release you want to go on to and check out there are some modification in the different KPS or counters so that's one thing moving on to counterpart if you want if you want to see any specific account we can always go back and set expand 51 now if I want to see anything which is specific to let's say release down
Chunk 31 - Text: I have each and everything which is related to release in that specific one so I can select all of them all together here just click it over here and add it over the board Chelsea all of these got added once you these are the custom things which you are doing so you want to say if you want to say if you know that this report will be using it further as well so all you can do you can save it under your folder you always have option of saving it saving this board so just name it over your maybe user under your user if you want to keep it to you only you have to share or not so it all depends upon you want to check it if you want to share it with others just checking so that's how the boards are created and this is how you full KPS or counter specifically whatever the counters which you need to switch on or which suits your you know finding RCA of particular improvement or degradation you can always go back and see which all counter for KPS you would really do that specific improvement of Degradation and politics that's one thing if you want to go and see any default report so it is always recommended to use system default report
Chunk 32 - Text: let's see if you are new to Nokia and you don't know what to see where to see always go for default report it will at least give you 70% of the insight of what went wrong or what went right so let's say for 5G we have this 5G 01 which is our system program which is at an hour level if you will go for this 00 this is at a BTS level same goes for 5 years girl 01 so we have it as level and if it is if will happen if you want to see what all specific account KPS are associated with this just click it over here you go to details can tell you content so these are the kpis which are associated with this specific system report that is used 201 the report which everyone should know take into consideration while analysis and on the top of that like let's say if you don't find anything or relevant we always have some default report which relates to either accessibility retainability mobility or integrity so depending upon the need we can always go back to the
Chunk 33 - Text: default Nokia reports and start digging deeper into that like let's say if I want to see accessibility and reliability report for this LT we have a report number Rs 8038 ok now these are with this report this has some additional counters or KPS which relates with which is in sync with you can say 80% of 70% would match with Rs 8001 but there are some 30% which is added on which may give you actual degradation ok so these are the default system report that can be always referred for analysis and then we have 307 which relates to retainability if something went wrong in the system and one find a way so that we have spike in a drop we can refer this report we can see which specific API went up what we can calculate with that KPI and the series of incident that happened in the network and find the RCA records so the data point of view then we got if you want to see anything with related to voice we can always refer 052 which is voltage report it has everything which relates to boys it is percentage of on and all so it has everything
Chunk 34 - Text: over the detail let's go back to see and go back and see details so it has everything related to it does have some kpis which relates to qci 8 as well but on the top of that this report is specifically for qci one so you always have some additional counter associated with this where you can visit and see what went wrong what went right or everything is on track or not post whatever the changes you did for let's say any specific reason ok so that's one of the voltage report has been increased or not so for that we can always referred 058 report which is the timing advance report we can go vacancy that's one thing then we have some basic report which is used to my mobile and then we can see I mean what is the percentage of rank 1 to rank for depending upon our setting whether we are on to cross true or false it depends upon I mean most of the percentage If you are using two cross two if it is 4 + 3 and 4 so here we can see this report we
Chunk 35 - Text: mama performance then we got 22 Rs 80 to 222 sorry so these are some we can see some quality KPI from this one and if you want to see what all specific reports are there with respect to LT just remove everything and type r s l t that is enough it will allow you to see what all reports do we have it and what all report we can use it for a specific analysis any query related to this reporting site from anyone know the report someone is not aware of it can use it for quick reference and search it so this is how it looks like and again whatever you have created or like I have created I'll find it over this time which is like my content it could be either under Board of KPI so like let's say these are the reports which I have created so far I want to see if I want to refer any specific template with someone else has created I can always go and it is shared like let's sharing your report so if it is said already you can refer this time specific report and you can calculate
Chunk 36 - Text: KPS you can always open it and work on it so that's one thing ok now they are different things that can be applied like let say I have felt this specific report which relates to this as JNV release initial initiation due to user in activity ok we always have option of Editing in the configuration I have once clicking it over you can either remove it or undo it like let's say I want to remove specific area I'll just click on this one you want to continue I can always change the number of days then I can always change granularity or you can say at what level I want to see it if I want to see at a specific syllabus and then we have this one day level now we can always apply filters you want to go for specific API let's say this one I don't want anything which is it could be anything any number you can define your number over here and finished it will return the value the way you want it so like let's say I mean for few of the report like I'll give a reference of hand over report so it is like a relational level and it could be the case that you want a new words or relational level things where the atoms are greater than 500 or 600 in a day so you can always apply this filter
Chunk 37 - Text: based on this filter the report which will come come out its gonna be precisely which you want to analyse for the betterment of the network so this is how this specific filters work ok and again like let's say I'll give you just instance for this initiation I'll just wrote one and we can it's not only that we can we can have a number of things here we just need whether it's and or operation which will come into picture if I want to see something which should be less than one and anything may be equal to 10 it will apply the condition accordingly you just need to finish that has been made for that specific thing it is not returning any value moreover I have just selected one cell if you want to go for a masking we can apply this filter we can select the cells which we want to work and working then we have a KPI manager as well so here we can customise our we can calculate say if you want to specific API or counter which you not counter you want to create a KPI basically out of few of the counters and you want to explore some of you can always come here based on based on the technology you can select whether it is LT
Chunk 38 - Text: aur Nokia let's say I want to create anything for LT 23 or 1 you can write anything may be whatever the name you want to select then you need to have Counter description with you what all counters you need to know you need to have it in your report then KPI or what you want to associate in that format you can import it over here it's something is wrong with the formula for it won't give you option of creating so we need to login go back and see whether it is meeting the criteria or weather it will have some value or not if everything is fine it will give you option of creating creating an API and then you can save it and this is customer that can be created I think done with this pm + anyone has any query related to this one or if someone wants to add up on the top of it may be I would have some point someone to add on no ok
Chunk 39 - Text: yamkeshwar station you can stop the recording actually otherwise it will make it very big yeah I was just telling that we can schedule it
